# YouTube App

The project involves creating a website using React, a popular front-end development library. The website will connect with the YouTube API, which allows us to access YouTube's vast collection of videos.

The website will have different pages and features to enhance the user experience. It will include a homepage where users can search for videos using a search bar and view popular or trending videos. When a user searches for a video, they will see a page displaying the results. Clicking on a video will take them to a page showing more details about that video, such as its title, description, and thumbnail.

Users will also be able to sign up, sign in, and manage their accounts. They can save their favorite videos, create playlists, and subscribe to channels. Additionally, there will be pages dedicated to specific YouTube channels, where users can explore the channel's uploaded videos, playlists, and subscriber count.

To make it easier for users to discover videos, the website may include predefined categories or topics. Users can select a category or topic and see a list of videos related to that selection.

Lastly, the project will have error pages for situations like page not found or other common errors to ensure a smooth user experience.

Overall, the goal is to create an engaging and user-friendly website that leverages the YouTube API to provide a seamless video browsing experience.
